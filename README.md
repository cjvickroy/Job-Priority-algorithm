# Job-Priority-algorithm
A program that finds the most optimal schedule for certain job times

# Input file
The input file requires 2 things:
- The number of jobs in the file
- The job's ID, start time, and end time

See [act.txt](https://github.com/cjvickroy/Job-Priority-algorithm/blob/main/act.txt) for an example.

In the text file, you will find that there are 11 job, as pointed out by the first line. 

Each job has a specific ID, start time, and end time, in that order.

# How to compile and run

On a command line, run:

`g++ LastToStart.cpp`
and
`./a.out`

Ensure that "act.txt" is present in the same directory

# Output 
The program will output the most efficient job schedule, along with each job that it chose.
